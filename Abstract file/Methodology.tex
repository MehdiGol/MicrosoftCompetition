\section{Data Extraction and Analysis} 

The \textsf{libraries.io} monitoring service contains package metadata, including dependencies for 36 different package managers.
I have selected the Cargo package manager for the Rust programming language as a first case study. It was created in 2014, and most of its packages are developed on GitHub. 
Cargo is growing fast in number of packages, package releases, dependencies and contributors~\cite{Decan2019EMSE}. 
%By studying this package dependency network I hope to gain insights into how the ecosystem growth affects the socio-technical congruence over time and vice versa.

I used on a datadump of \textsf{libraries.io}~\cite{Katz2018} to extract the temporal evolution of Cargo's package dependency network. 
For each package, I extracted %metadata such as
 the package name, release number and date, maintainer, package dependencies and their versioning constraints. 
The dataset contained $+15K$ packages, $+66K$ package releases and $+48K$ dependency relations.
I retrieved the (optional) link to the corresponding development repositories and filtered out packages for which no GitHub repository was found (1,984 cases) %1984 = 1571 + 413 
or that corresponded to duplicate repository links (3,500 cases).
 % I also found that 1571 of records contain no repository address, 413 of them have repository address other than GitHub and 3500 of them contains duplicate repository address.
I downloaded the relevant historical socio-technical data from the remaining 9,954 GitHub repositories.
%TO DO: Mention here how big is the libraries.io dataset you used (after filtering): how many packages; how many package releases; how may package dependencies; how many github repositories}
This data includes all contributors and their role, the \emph{social} commenting activities they were involved in ($+904K$ comments separated into commit comments, pull request comments, pull request review comments and issue comments), and the \emph{technical} development activities they had conducted ($+942K$ commits, $+145K$ pull requests and $+266K$ issues).
%The downloaded metadata was also fairly big including 942183 commits, 145053 pull requests, 266033 issues, 90228 unique comments-contributor.
%It is worthwhile to mention that 
3,170 repositories had no comments, and comments follow the Pareto rule ($80\%$ of all comments belong to $<20\%$ of all repositories).
