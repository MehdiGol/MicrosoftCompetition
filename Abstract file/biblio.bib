	Abstract = {While researchers are becoming increasingly interested in studying OSS phenomenon, there is still a small number of studies analyzing larger samples of projects investigating the structure of activities among OSS developers. The significant amount of information that has been gathered in the publicly available open-source software repositories and mailing-list archives offers an opportunity to analyze projects structures and participant involvement. In this article, using on commits data from 263 Apache projects repositories (nearly all), we show that although OSS development is often described as collaborative, but it in fact predominantly relies on radically solitary input and individual, non-collaborative contributions. We also show, in the first published study of this magnitude, that the engagement of contributors is based on a power-law distribution.},

	Abstract = {The crowds' continuous participation and contribution are the key factors for the success of open source projects. However, among the massive competitors, it is difficult for a project to attract enough contributors by just passively waiting for enthusiasts to join in. Instead, it should actively seek gifted developers. Most of the current studies mainly focus on recommending experts inside a repository for some specific development tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ConRec to recommend potential contributors across the entire open source community for given projects. It lever- ages the developers' historical activities in projects to analyze their technical interests and technical connections with others. Thereafter, it combines collaborative filtering algorithm with text matching algorithm to recommend proper developers. We conducted extensive experiments on 5,995 open source projects and 2,938,620 developers in GitHub. The results show that the proposed algorithm can recommend contributors to open source projects with the best performance of 63% in accuracy, and solve the cold start problem as well.},

@article{Qi2014,
	Abstract = { In open source software (OSS) projects, participants initially communicate with others and then may become developers if they are deemed worthy by the community. Recent studies indicate that the abundance of established social links of a participant is the strongest predictor to his/her promotion. Having reliable rankings of the candidates is key to recruiting and maintaining a successful operation of an OSS project. This paper adopts degree-based, PageRank, and Hits ranking algorithms to rank developer candidates in OSS projects based on their social links. We construct several types of social networks based on the communications between the participants in Apache OSS projects, then train and test the ranking algorithms in these networks. We find that, for all the ranking algorithms under study, the rankings of emergent developers in temporal networks are higher than those in cumulative ones, indicating that the more recent communications of a developer in a project are more important to predict his/her first commit in the project. By comparison, the simple degree-based and the PageRank ranking algorithms in temporal undirected weighted networks behave better than the others in identifying emergent developers based on four performance indicators, and are thus recommended to be applied in the future. },

@inproceedings{Ihara2014,
	Abstract = {There exists two types of developers in Open Source Software (OSS) projects: 1) Committers who have permission to commit edited source code to the Version Control System (VCS), 2) Developers who contribute source code but cannot commit to the VCS directly. In order to develop and evolve high quality OSS, projects are always in search of new committers. OSS projects often promote strong developers to become committers. When existing committers find strong developers, they propose their promotion to a committer role. Delaying the committer-promotion might lead to strong developers departing from an OSS project and the project losing them. However early committer-promotion comes with its own slew of risks as well (e.g., the promotion of inexperienced developers). Hence, committer-promotion decisions are critical for the quality and successful evolution of OSS projects. In this paper, we examine the committer-promotion phenomena for two OSS projects (Eclipse and Firefox). We find that the amount of activities by future committers was higher than the amount of activities by developers who did not become committers). We also find that some developers are promoted to a committer role very rapidly (within a few month) while some of developers take over one year to become a committer. Finally, we develop a committer-identification model to assist OSS projects identifying future committers.},

	Abstract = {Statecharts constitute an executable language for modelling event-based reactive systems. The essential complexity of statechart models solicits the need for advanced model testing and validation techniques. In this article, we propose a method aimed at enhancing statechart design with a range of techniques that have proven their usefulness to increase the quality and reliability of source code. The method is accompanied by a process that flexibly accommodates testing and validation techniques such as test-driven development, behaviour-driven development, design by contract, and property statecharts that check for violations of behavioural properties during statechart execution. The method is supported by the Sismic tool, an open-source statechart interpreter library in Python, which supports all the aforementioned techniques. Based on this tooling, we carry out a controlled user study to evaluate the feasibility, usefulness and adequacy of the proposed techniques for statechart testing and validation.},

@article{Mordal2013,
	Abstract = {With the growing need for quality assessment of entire software systems in the industry, new issues are emerging. First, because most software quality metrics are defined at the level of individual software components, there is a need for aggregation methods to summarize the results at the system level. Second, because a software evaluation requires the use of different metrics, with possibly widely varying output ranges, there is a need to combine these results into a unified quality assessment. In this paper we derive, from our experience on real industrial cases and from the scientific literature, requirements for an aggregation method. We then present a solution through the Squale model for metric aggregation, a model specifically designed to address the needs of practitioners. We empirically validate the adequacy of Squale through experiments on Eclipse. Additionally, we compare the Squale model to both traditional aggregation techniques (e.g., the arithmetic mean), and to econometric inequality indices (e.g., the Gini or the Theil indices), recently applied to aggregation of software metrics.},

@article{Chao2003,
	Abstract = {A biological community usually has a large number of species with relatively small abundances. When a random sample of individuals is selected and each individual is classified according to species identity, some rare species may not be discovered. This paper is concerned with the estimation of Shannon's index of diversity when the number of species and the species abundances are unknown. The traditional estimator that ignores the missing species underestimates when there is a non-negligible number of unseen species. We provide a different approach based on unequal probability sampling theory because species have different probabilities of being discovered in the sample. No parametric forms are assumed for the species abundances. The proposed estimation procedure combines the Horvitz--Thompson (1952) adjustment for missing species and the concept of sample coverage, which is used to properly estimate the relative abundances of species discovered in the sample. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator works well under various abundance models even when a relatively large fraction of the species is missing. Three real data sets, two from biology and the other one from numismatics, are given for illustration.},

In this context, an important question for both researchers and practitioners is: what is the expected lifetime of contributors in a community? Answering this question, we will be able to characterize these communities as an appropriate model can show whether or not users maintain their interest to contribute, for how long we could expect them to collaborate and, as a result, improve the organization and management of the project. In this paper, we demonstrate that survival analysis, a wellknown statistical methodology in other research areas such as epidemiology, biology or demographic studies, is a useful methodology to undertake a quantitative comparison of the lifetime of contributors in open collaborative initiatives, like the development of FLOSS projects and the Wikipedia, providing insightful answers to this challenging question.},

	Abstract = {Component-based systems often describe context requirements in terms of explicit inter-component dependencies. Studying large instances of such systems - such as free and open source software (FOSS) distributions - in terms of declared dependencies between packages is appealing. It is however also misleading when the language to express dependencies is as expressive as Boolean formulae, which is often the case. In such settings, a more appropriate notion of component dependency exists: strong dependency. This paper introduces such notion as a first step towards modeling semantic, rather then syntactic, inter-component relationships. Furthermore, a notion of component sensitivity is derived from strong dependencies, with applications to quality assurance and to the evaluation of upgrade risks. An empirical study of strong dependencies and sensitivity is presented, in the context of one of the largest, freely available, component-based system.},

@inproceedings{Sneed2014TD,
	Abstract = {Technical Debt is a term coined by Ward Cunningham to denote the amount of rework required to put a piece of software into that state which it should have had from the beginning. The term outdates the agile revolution. Technical debt can occur using any development approach, but since agile development has become wide spread the notion of ``technical debt'' has gained much more attention. That is because if agile development is not done properly, technical debt accrues very fast and threatens to strangle the project. In this paper the author describes how technical debt comes to being, how it can be measured and what can be done to prevent it in agile development. The emphasis of the paper is on how to prevent it. What measures are necessary in an agile development project to keep technical debt from accruing over time? The paper lists out a number of measures which can be taken -- organizational, procedural and technical. Automated tools play an important role in the struggle against technical debt. Samples are given how a tool can be helpful in identifying and removing problems before they get out of hand. Also important is an external auditing agency which monitors projects in progress with the aide of automated tools. In the end a case study is presented which illustrates the monitoring of technical debt within an agile development and what counter measures are required to stop it.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for learning in structured domains (SDs) using a constructive neural network for graphs (NN4G). The new model allows the extension of the input domain for supervised neural networks to a general class of graphs including both acyclic/cyclic, directed/undirected labeled graphs. In particular, the model can realize adaptive contextual transductions, learning the mapping from graphs for both classification and regression tasks. In contrast to previous neural networks for structures that had a recursive dynamics, NN4G is based on a constructive feedforward architecture with state variables that uses neurons with no feedback connections. The neurons are applied to the input graphs by a general traversal process that relaxes the constraints of previous approaches derived by the causality assumption over hierarchical input data. Moreover, the incremental approach eliminates the need to introduce cyclic dependencies in the definition of the system state variables. In the traversal process, the NN4G units exploit (local) contextual information of the graphs vertices. In spite of the simplicity of the approach, we show that, through the compositionality of the contextual information developed by the learning, the model can deal with contextual information that is incrementally extended according to the graphs topology.

	Abstract = {The "wisdom of crowds" argument emphasizes the importance of diversity in online collaborations, such as open source projects and Wikipedia. However, decades of research on diversity in offline work groups have painted an inconclusive picture. On the one hand, the broader range of insights from a diverse group can lead to improved outcomes. On the other hand, individual differences can lead to conflict and diminished performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of group diversity on the amount of work accomplished and on member withdrawal behaviors in the context of WikiProjects. We find that increased diversity in experience with Wikipedia increases group productivity and decreases member withdrawal -- up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns were observed for differences in member interest, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal in a linear fashion. Our results suggest that the low visibility of individual differences in online groups may allow them to harvest more of the benefits of diversity while bearing less of the cost. We discuss how our findings can inform further research of online collaboration.},

	Abstract = {The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time.},

	Abstract = {The widespread adoption of free and open source software (FOSS) in many strategic contexts of the information technology society has drawn the attention on the issues regarding how to handle the complexity of assembling and managing a huge number of (packaged) components in a consistent and effective way. FOSS distributions (and in particular GNU/Linux-based ones) have always provided tools for managing the tasks of installing, removing and upgrading the (packaged) components they were made of While these tools provide a (not always effective) way to handle these tasks on the client side, there is still a lack of tools that could help the distribution editors to maintain, on the server side, large and high-quality distributions. In this paper we present our research whose main goal is to fill this gap: we show our approach, the tools we have developed and their application with experimental results. Our contribution provides an effective and automatic way to support distribution editors in handling those issues that were, until now, mostly addressed using ad-hoc tools and manual techniques},

	Abstract = {Systems that depend on third-party libraries may have to be updated when updates to these libraries become available in order to benefit from new functionality, security patches, bug fixes, or API improvements. However, often such changes come with changes to the existing interfaces of these libraries, possibly causing rework on the client system. In this paper, we investigate versioning practices in a set of more than 100,000 jar files from Maven Central, spanning over 7 years of history of more than 22,000 different libraries. We investigate to what degree versioning conventions are followed in this repository. Semantic versioning provides strict rules regarding major (breaking changes allowed), minor (no breaking changes allowed), and patch releases (only backward-compatible bug fixes allowed). We find that around one third of all releases introduce at least one breaking change. We perform an empirical study on potential rework caused by breaking changes in library releases and find that breaking changes have a significant impact on client libraries using the changed functionality. We find out that minor releases generally have larger release intervals than major releases. We also investigate the use of deprecation tags and find out that these tags are applied improperly in our dataset.},

Negotiating change can be tricky: changes to one module may cause ripple effects to many other modules that depend on it, yet insisting on only backward-compatible changes may incur significant opportunity cost and stifle change. We argue that awareness mechanisms based on various notions of stability can enable developers to make decisions that are independent yet wise and provide stewardship rather than disruption to the ecosystem. In ongoing interviews with developers in two software ecosystems (CRAN and Node.js), we are finding that developers in fact struggle with change, that they often use adhoc mechanisms to negotiate change, and that existing awareness mechanisms like Github notification feeds are rarely used due to information overload. We study the state of the art and current information needs and outline a vision toward a change-based awareness system.},

	Abstract = {Web developers routinely rely on third-party Java- Script libraries such as jQuery to enhance the functionality of their sites. However, if not properly maintained, such dependen- cies can create attack vectors allowing a site to be compromised.
In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of client-side JavaScript library usage and the resulting security implications across the Web. Using data from over 133 k websites, we show that 37% of them include at least one library with a known vulnerability; the time lag behind the newest release of a library is measured in the order of years. In order to better understand why websites use so many vulnerable or outdated libraries, we track causal inclusion relationships and quantify different scenarios. We observe sites including libraries in ad hoc and often transitive ways, which can lead to different versions of the same library being loaded into the same document at the same time. Furthermore, we find that libraries included transitively, or via ad and tracking code, are more likely to be vulnerable. This demonstrates that not only website administrators, but also the dynamic architecture and developers of third-party services are to blame for the Web's poor state of library management.
The results of our work underline the need for more thorough approaches to dependency management, code maintenance and third-party code inclusion on the Web},

	Abstract = {We exploit recent advances in analysis of graph topology to better understand software evolution, and to construct predictors that facilitate software development and maintenance. Managing an evolving, collaborative software system is a complex and expensive process, which still cannot ensure software reliability. Emerging techniques in graph mining have revolutionized the modeling of many complex systems and processes. We show how we can use a graph-based characterization of a software system to capture its evolution and facilitate development, by helping us estimate bug severity, prioritize refactoring efforts, and predict defect-prone releases. Our work consists of three main thrusts. First, we construct graphs that capture software structure at two different levels: (a) the product, i.e., source code and module level, and (b) the process, i.e., developer collaboration level. We identify a set of graph metrics that capture interesting properties of these graphs. Second, we study the evolution of eleven open source programs, including Firefox, Eclipse, MySQL, over the lifespan of the programs, typically a decade or more. Third, we show how our graph metrics can be used to construct predictors for bug severity, high-maintenance software parts, and failure-prone releases. Our work strongly suggests that using graph topology analysis concepts can open many actionable avenues in software engineering research and practice.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of bugs in software systems has been shown to satisfy the Pareto principle, and typically shows a power-law tail when analyzed as a rank-frequency plot. In a recent paper, Zhang showed that the Weibull cumulative distribution is a very good fit for the Alberg diagram of bugs built with experimental data. In this paper, we further discuss the subject from a statistical perspective, using as case studies five versions of Eclipse, to show how log-normal, Double-Pareto, and Yule-Simon distributions may fit the bug distribution at least as well as the Weibull distribution. In particular, we show how some of these alternative distributions provide both a superior fit to empirical data and a theoretical motivation to be used for modeling the bug generation process. While our results have been obtained on Eclipse, we believe that these models, in particular the Yule-Simon one, can generalize to other software systems.},

In a span of 6 years since its inception, npm has grown to become one of the largest software ecosystems, hosting more than 230, 000 packages, with hundreds of millions of package installations every week. In this paper, we examine the npm ecosystem from two complementary perspectives: 1) we look at package descriptions, the dependencies among them, and download metrics, and 2) we look at the use of npm packages in publicly available applications hosted on GitHub. In both perspectives, we consider historical data, providing us with a unique view on the evolution of the ecosystem. We present analyses that provide insights into the ecosystem's growth and activity, into conflicting measures of package popularity, and into the adoption of package versions over time. These insights help understand the evolution of npm, design better package recommendation engines, and can help developers understand how their packages are being used.},

In this context, collaborative activities are accomplished in different domains, and their relations allow researchers to model them as complex networks in order to obtain insights and competitive advantage. Software Ecosystems are emerging as a new way to contribute to developing and maintaining software through an active community of engaged users. Recognizing how users collaborate is a complex task that can help understand the network. This paper aims at analyzing a Software Ecosystem through its social layer. To this end, different complex networks were modeled using data extracted from the Eclipse ecosystem version control system. The networks represent interactions among users and projects.

	Abstract = {Many third party libraries are available to be downloaded and used. Using such libraries can reduce development time and make the developed software more reliable. However, developers are often unaware of suitable libraries to be used for their projects and thus they miss out on these benefits. To help developers better take advantage of the available libraries, we propose a new technique that automatically recommends libraries to developers. Our technique takes as input the set of libraries that an application currently uses, and recommends other libraries that are likely to be relevant. We follow a hybrid approach that combines association rule mining and collaborative filtering. The association rule mining component recommends libraries based on a set of library usage patterns. The collaborative filtering component recommends libraries based on those that are used by other similar projects. We investigate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach on 500 software projects that use many third-party libraries. Our experiments show that our approach can recommend libraries with recall rate@5 of 0.852 and recall rate@10 of 0.894.},

To address this weakness, we propose RecRank, an approach and tool that applies a novel ranking-based discriminative approach leveraging API usage path features to improve top-1 API recommendation. Empirical evaluation on a large corpus of (1385+8) open source projects shows that RecRank significantly improves top-1 API recommendation accuracy and mean reciprocal rank when compared to state-of-the-art API recommendation approaches.},

To attain competitiveness in complex tasks, crowdsourced software developers often choose to work with others collaboratively. However, existing crowdsourcing platforms generally assume independent contributions from developers and do not provide effective support for team formation. Prior studies on team recommendation aim at optimizing task outcomes by recommending the most suitable team for a task instead of finding appropriate collaborators for a specific person. In this work, we are concerned with teammate recommendation for crowdsourcing developers. First, we present the results of an empirical study of Kaggle, which shows that developers'personal teammate preferences are mainly affected by three factors. Second, we give a collaboration willingness model to characterize developers' teammate preferences and formulate teammate recommendation as an optimization problem. Then we design a heuristic algorithm to find suitable teammates for a developer. Finally, we have conducted a set of experiments on a Kaggle dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	Abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice where developers constantly integrate their changes to a project through an automated build process. The goal of CI is to provide developers with prompt feedback on several quality dimensions after each change. Indeed, previous studies provided empirical evidence on a positive association between properly following CI principles and source code quality. A core principle behind CI is Continuous Code Quality (also known as CCQ, which includes automated testing and automated code inspection) may appear simple and effective, yet we know little about its practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a preliminary empirical investigation aimed at understanding how rigorously practitioners follow CCQ. Our study reveals a strong dichotomy between theory and practice: developers do not perform continuous inspection but rather control for quality only at the end of a sprint and most of the times only on the release branch.

The early identification of developers who are likely to remain is thus an eminent challenge for the management of FLOSS initiatives. Previous research has shown that individuals' subjective assessment is often inaccurate emphasizing the need to objectively evaluate retention behavior. Consistent with the concepts Person-Job (P-J) and Person-Team (P-T) fit from the traditional recruitment literature, we derive objective measures to predict developer retention in FLOSS projects. In an analysis of the contribution behavior of former Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students we reveal that the level of development experience and conversational knowledge is strongly associated with retention. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that students with abilities that are underrepresented in the project and students with a higher academic education do not remain considerably longer.},

	Abstract = {Developers neglect to update legacy software dependencies, resulting in buggy and insecure software. One explanation for this neglect is the difficulty of constantly checking for the availability of new software updates, verifying their safety, and addressing any migration efforts needed when upgrading a dependency. Emerging tools attempt to address this problem by introducing automated pull requests and project badges to inform the developer of stale dependencies. To understand whether these tools actually help developers, we analyzed 7,470 GitHub projects that used these notification mechanisms to identify any change in upgrade behavior. Our results find that, on average, projects that use pull request notifications upgraded 1.6× as often as projects that did not use any tools. Badge notifications were slightly less effective: users upgraded 1.4× more frequently. Unfortunately, although pull request notifications are useful, developers are often overwhelmed by notifications: only a third of pull requests were actually merged. Through a survey, 62 developers indicated that their most significant concerns are breaking changes, understanding the implications of changes, and migration effort. The implications of our work suggests ways in which notifications can be improved to better align with developers' expectations and the need for new mechanisms to reduce notification fatigue and improve confidence in automated pull requests.},

However, several studies have highlighted the risks and dangers brought about by application developers keeping dependencies on outdated library versions. Intelligent mining of super repositories could reveal hidden trends within the corresponding software ecosystem and thereby provide valuable insights for such dependency-related decisions. In this paper, we propose the Software Universe Graph (SUG) Model as a structured abstraction of the evolution of software systems and their library dependencies over time. To demonstrate the SUG's usefulness, we conduct an empirical study using 6,374 Maven artifacts and over 6,509 CRAN packages mined from their real-world ecosystems. Visualizations of the SUG model such as `library coexistence pairings' and `dependents diffusion' uncover popularity, adoption and diffusion patterns within each software ecosystem. Results show the Maven ecosystem as having a more conservative approach to dependency updating than the CRAN ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Third-party library reuse has become common practice in contemporary software development, as it includes several benefits for developers. Library dependencies are constantly evolving, with newly added features and patches that fix bugs in older versions. To take full advantage of third-party reuse, developers should always keep up to date with the latest versions of their library dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the extent of which developers update their library dependencies. Specifically, we conducted an empirical study on library migration that covers over 4,600 GitHub software projects and 2,700 library dependencies. Results show that although many of these systems rely heavily on dependencies, 81.5% of the studied systems still keep their outdated dependencies. In the case of updating a vulnerable dependency, the study reveals that affected developers are not likely to respond to a security advisory. Surveying these developers, we find that 69% of the interviewees claimed to be unaware of their vulnerable dependencies. Moreover, developers are not likely to prioritize a library update, as it is perceived to be extra workload and responsibility. This study concludes that even though third-party reuse is common practice, updating a dependency is not as common for many developers.},

However, adding a package to a project can also introduce risks, which can propagate through multiple levels of dependencies. Currently, not much is known about the structure of open-source package ecosystems of popular programming languages and the extent to which transitive bug propagation is possible. This paper analyzes the dependency network structure and evolution of the JavaScript, Ruby, and Rust ecosystems. The reported results reveal significant differences across language ecosystems. The results indicate that the number of transitive dependencies for JavaScript has grown 60% over the last year, suggesting that developers should look more carefully into their dependencies to understand what exactly is included. The study also reveals that vulnerability to a removal of the most popular package is increasing, yet most other packages have a decreasing impact on vulnerability. The findings of this study can inform the development of dependency management tools.},

@article{Blincoe2019,
	Abstract = {Context
Software projects often depend on other projects or are developed in tandem with other projects. Within such software ecosystems, knowledge of cross-project technical dependencies is important for (1) practitioners understanding of the impact of their code change and coordination needs within the ecosystem and (2) researchers in exploring properties of software ecosystems based on these technical dependencies. However, identifying technical dependencies at the ecosystem level can be challenging.
Objective
In this paper, we describe Reference Coupling, a new method that uses solely the information in developers online interactions to detect technical dependencies between projects. The method establishes dependencies through user-specified cross-references between projects. We then use the output of this method to explore the properties of large software ecosystems.
Method
We validate our method on two datasets --- one from open-source projects hosted on GitHub and one commercial dataset of IBM projects. We manually analyze the identified dependencies, categorize them, and compare them to dependencies specified by the development team. We examine the types of projects involved in the identified ecosystems, the structure of the identified ecosystems, and how the ecosystems structure compares with the social behavior of project contributors and owners.
Results
We find that our Reference Coupling method often identifies technical dependencies between projects that are untracked by developers. We describe empirical insights about the characteristics of large software ecosystems. We find that most ecosystems are centered around one project and are interconnected with other ecosystems. By exploring the socio-technical alignment within the GitHub ecosystems, we also found that the project owners social behavior aligns well with the technical dependencies within the ecosystem, but the project contributors social behavior does not align with these dependencies.
Conclusions
We conclude with a discussion on future research that is enabled by our Reference Coupling method.},

	Abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

In the light of contemporary software development, when many companies rely on geographically distributed teams, which often turn out to be temporarily composed and thus having an often-changing communication structure, the importance of Conway's law and its inspired work grows. In this paper, we examine empirical research related to Conway's law and its application for cross-site coordination. Based on the results obtained we conjecture that changes in the communication structure alone sooner or later trigger changes in the design structure of the software products to return the socio-technical system into the state of congruence. This is further used to formulate a concept of a rubber band effect and propose a replication study that goes beyond the original idea of Conway's law by investigating the evolution of socio-technical congruence over time.},

	Abstract = {All kinds of software projects, whether open or closed source, rely on open source components. Repositories that serve open source components to organizations, such as the Central Repository and npmjs.org, report billions of requests per year. Despite the widespread reliance of projects on open source components, little is known about the social interactions that occur between developers of a project using a component and developers of the component itself. In this paper, we investigate the social interactions that occur for 5,133 pairs of projects, from two different communities (Java and Ruby) representing user projects that depend on a component project. We consider such questions as how often are there social interactions when a component is used? When do the social interactions occur? And, why do social interactions occur? From our investigation, we observed that social interactions typically occur after a component has been chosen for use and relied upon. When social interactions occur, they most frequently begin with creating issues or feature requests. We also found that the more use a component receives, the less likely it is that developers of project using the component will interact with the component project, and when those interactions occur, they will be shorter in duration. Our results provide insight into how socio-technical interactions occur beyond the level of an individual or small group of projects previously studied by others and identify the need for a new model of socio-technical congruence for dependencies between, instead of within, projects.},

	Abstract = {Summary Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development where the principle artefacts are models. In contrast, the state of the art in MDE support is model centric, where the code can be fully generated from the models. Accepting the basic idea that everything is a model, and adopting a model-centric view, we need techniques and tools that allow us to manipulate and reason about such models. The technique that can be used to achieve this is commonly referred to as model transformation. It is needed for supporting a wide range of model-driven activities such as code generation, model extraction, model refactoring, model verification, model simulation, and many more. Model transformation languages serve to specify the syntax and semantics of model transformations, and are essential if we want to provide automated support for model transformation. This chapter overviews a wide variety of model-based activities in which model transformations are essential. Controlled Vocabulary Terms data models; simulation languages},

	Abstract = {Socio-technical congruence is an approach that measures coordination by examining the alignment between the technical dependencies and the social coordination in the project. We conduct a case study of coordination in the IBM Rational Team Concert project, which consists of 151 developers over seven geographically distributed sites, and expect that high congruence leads to a high probability of successful builds. We examine this relationship by applying two congruence measurements: an unweighted congruence measure from previous literature, and a weighted measure that overcomes limitations of the existing measure. We discover that there is a relationship between socio-technical congruence and build success probability, but only for certain build types, and observe that in some situations, higher congruence actually leads to lower build success rates. We also observe that a large proportion of zero-congruence builds are successful, and that socio-technical gaps in successful builds are larger than gaps in failed builds. Analysis of the social and technical aspects in IBM Rational Team Concert allows us to discuss the effects of congruence on build success. Our findings provide implications with respect to the limits of applicability of socio-technical congruence and suggest further improvements of socio-technical congruence to study coordination.},

	Abstract = {Software development projects face a lot of risks (requirements inflation, poor scheduling, technical problems, etc.). Underestimating those risks may put in danger the project success. One of the most critical risks is the employee turnover, that is the risk of key personnel leaving the project. A good indicator to evaluate this risk is to measure the concentration of information in individual developers. This is also popularly known as the bus factor (``number of key developers who would need to be incapacitated, i.e. hit by a bus, to make a project unable to proceed''). Despite the simplicity of the concept, calculating the actual bus factor for specific projects can quickly turn into an error-prone and time-consuming activity as soon as the size of the project and development team increase. In order to help project managers to assess the bus factor of their projects, in this paper we present a tool that, given a Git-based repository, automatically measures the bus factor for any file, directory and branch in the repository and for the project itself. You can also simulate with the tool what would happen to the project (e.g., which files would become orphans) if one or more developers disappeared.},

In the case of social debt, decisions are about people and their interactions. Our objective was to study the causality around social debt in practice. In so doing, we conducted exploratory qualitative research in a large software company. We found many forces together causing social debt; we represented them in a framework, and captured anti-patterns that led to the debt in the first place. Finally, we elicited best practices that technicians adopted to pay back some of the accumulated debt. We learned that social debt is strongly correlated with technical debt and both forces should be reckoned with together during the software process.},

In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the relation between social organization and performance in Gentoo, an Open Source community developing a Linux distribution. We study the structure and dynamics of collaborations as recorded in the project's bug tracking system over a period of ten years. We identify a period of increasing centralization after which most interactions in the community were mediated by a single central contributor. In this period of maximum centralization, the central contributor unexpectedly left the project, thus posing a significant challenge for the community. We quantify how the rise, the activity as well as the subsequent sudden dropout of this central contributor affected both the social organization and the bug handling performance of the Gentoo community. We analyze social organization from the perspective of network theory and augment our quantitative findings by interviews with prominent members of the Gentoo community which shared their personal insights.},

These dependencies are regularly updated, for example to add new features, resolve bugs or fix security issues. In order to take full advantage of the benefits of this type of reuse, developers should keep their dependencies up to date by relying on the latest releases. In practice, however, this is not always possible, and packages lag behind with respect to the latest version of their dependencies. This phenomenon is described as technical lag in the literature. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of technical lag in the npm dependency network by investigating its evolution for over 1.4M releases of 120K packages and 8M dependencies between these releases. We explore how technical lag increases over time, taking into account the release type and the use of package dependency constraints. We also discuss how technical lag can be reduced by relying on the semantic versioning policy.},

	Abstract = {Packaging software into containers is becoming a common practice when deploying services in cloud and other environments. Docker images are one of the most popular container technologies for building and deploying containers. A container image usually includes a collection of software packages, that can have bugs and security vulnerabilities that affect the container health. Our goal is to support container deployers by analysing the relation between outdated containers and vulnerable and buggy packages installed in them. We use the concept of technical lag of a container as the difference between a given container and the most up-to-date container that is possible with the most recent releases of the same collection of packages. For 7,380 official and community Docker images that are based on the Debian Linux distribution, we identify which software packages are installed in them and measure their technical lag in terms of version updates, security vulnerabilities and bugs. We have found, among others, that no release is devoid of vulnerabilities, so deployers cannot avoid vulnerabilities even if they deploy the most recent packages. We offer some lessons learned for container developers in regard to the strategies they can follow to minimize the number of vulnerabilities. We argue that Docker container scan and security management tools should improve their platforms by adding data about other kinds of bugs and include the measurement of technical lag to offer deployers information of when to update.},

	Abstract = {Containerized applications, and in particular Docker images, are becoming a common solution in cloud environments to meet ever-increasing demands in terms of portability, reliability and fast deployment. A Docker image includes all environmental dependencies required to run it, such as specific versions of system and third-party packages. Leveraging on its modularity, an image can be easily embedded in other images, thus simplifying the way of sharing dependencies and building new software. However, the dependencies included in an image may be out of date due to backward compatibility requirements, endangering the environments where the image has been deployed with known vulnerabilities. While previous research efforts have focused on studying the impact of bugs and vulnerabilities of system packages within Docker images, no attention has been given to third-party packages. This paper empirically studies the impact of npm JavaScript package vulnerabilities in Docker images. We based our analysis on 961 images from three official repositories that use Node.js, and 1,099 security reports of packages available on npm, the most popular JavaScript package manager. Our results reveal that the presence of outdated npm packages in Docker images increases the risk of potential security vulnerabilities, suggesting that Docker maintainers should keep their installed JavaScript packages up to date.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Reusable Open Source Software (OSS) components for major programming languages are available in package repositories. Developers rely on package management tools to automate deployments, specifying which package releases satisfy the needs of their applications. However, these specifications may lead to deploying package releases that are outdated, or otherwise undesirable, because they do not include bug fixes, security fixes, or new functionality. In contrast, automatically updating to a more recent release may introduce incompatibility issues. To capture this delicate balance, we formalise a generic model of technical lag, a concept that quantifies to which extent a deployed collection of components is outdated, with respect to the ideal deployment. We operationalise this model for the npm package manager. We empirically analyze the history of package update practices and technical lag for more than 500K packages with about 4M package releases over a seven-year period. We consider both development and runtime dependencies, and study both direct and transitive dependencies. We also analyze the technical lag of external GitHub applications depending on npm packages. We report our findings, suggesting the need for more awareness of, and integrated tool support for, controlling technical lag in software libraries.},

Both social and technical changes affect an ecosystem's evolution and the research community has been investigating the impact of these modifications over the last few years. Existing studies mainly focus on temporary modifications, often ignoring the effect of permanent changes on the software ecosystem. We present an empirical study of the magnitude and effect of permanent modifications in both the social and technical parts of a software ecosystem. More precisely, we measure permanent changes with regard to the ecosystem's projects, contributors and source code files and present our findings concerning the effect of these modifications. We study the Ruby ecosystem in GitHub over a nine-year period by carrying out a socio-technical analysis of the co-evolution of a large number of base projects and their forks. This analysis involves both the source code developed for these projects as well as the developers having contributed to them. We discuss our findings with respect to the ecosystem evolution according to three different viewpoints: (1) the base projects, (2) the forks and (3) the entire ecosystem containing both the base projects and forks. Our findings show an increased growth in both the technical and social aspects of the Ruby ecosystem until early 2014, followed by an increased contributor and project abandonment rate. We show the effect of permanent modifications in the ecosystem evolution and provide preliminary evidence of contributors migrating to other ecosystems when leaving the Ruby ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Security vulnerabilities are among the most pressing problems in open source software package libraries. It may take a long time to discover and fix vulnerabilities in packages. In addition, vulnerabilities may propagate to dependent packages, making them vulnerable too. This paper presents an empirical study of nearly 400 security reports over a 6-year period in the npm dependency network containing over 610k JavaScript packages. Taking into account the severity of vulnerabilities, we analyse how and when these vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, and to which extent they affect other packages in the packaging ecosystem in presence of dependency constraints. We report our findings and provide guidelines for package maintainers and tool developers to improve the process of dealing with security issues.},

	Abstract = {With the development of open source community, through the interaction of developers, the collaborative development of software, and the sharing of software tools, the formation of open source software ecosystem has matured. Natural ecosystems provide ecological services on which human beings depend. Maintaining a healthy natural ecosystem is a necessity for the sustainable development of mankind. Similarly, maintaining a healthy ecosystem of open source software is also a prerequisite for the sustainable development of open source communities, such as GitHub. This paper takes GitHub as an example to analyze the health condition of open source ecosystem and, also, it is a research area in Symmetry. Firstly, the paper presents the healthy definition of GitHub open source ecosystem health and, then, according to the main components of natural ecosystem health, the paper proposes the health indicators and health indicators evaluation method. Based on the above, the GitHub ecosystem health prediction method is proposed. By analyzing the projects and data collected in GitHub, it is found that, using the proposed evaluation indicators and method, we can analyze the healthy development trend of the GitHub ecosystem and contribute to the stability of ecosystem development.},

	Abstract = {In model-based development of embedded real-time systems, statecharts are widely used for formal specification of their behavior, providing a sound basis for test generation and for detection of faults early in the development process. The paper presents a variety of new mutations for adequacy evaluation of tests used in validation of statecharts-based models. These mutations focus on key features of statecharts used in modeling of embedded systems: hierarchy, orthogonality and time expressions. We distinguish between two levels of tests adequacy. In the first, test results are expected to strictly follow the statecharts semantics. The second one takes into account possible deviations from this semantics based on typical implementation oriented decisions, e.g. mapping of orthogonal components into separate tasks executed concurrently. The considered mutations address both types of adequacy. In particular, we consider interleaving enforcing mutations, for testing of alternatives to the canonical "maximum parallelism " execution of statecharts.},

	Abstract = {Faults and failures due to interaction are the bane of testers. Since their subtlety makes them difficult to recognize and even more difficult to reveal by testing, it is important to specify interaction between classes systematically. In this paper, we propose mutation-based inter-class testing technique. Our inter-class testing technique consists of two procedures: test item identification procedure and test case selection procedure. For the test item identification procedure, we develop the Inheritance-Call graph (ICgraph) to identify the taxonomy of interaction of public methods between classes. For the test case selection procedure, we design a new criterion, state-based mutation testing criterion (SMTC), by applying mutation analysis to the state diagram representing class behavior. Mutation analysis is a well-known method for measuring test case adequacy which involves the mutation of a program by the introduction of small syntactic change in the program. The implementation of our proposed technique on a sample program shows that our technique leads to a set of test cases which detect errors in inter-class relation},

	Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to provide a brief review of the program testing technique known as `mutation testing' and outline current research directions in this area. Mutation testing is an example of what is sometimes called an error-based testing technique. In other words, it involves the construction of test data designed to uncover specific errors or classes of errors. A large number of simple changes (mutations) are made to a program, one at a time. Test data then has to be found which distinguishes the mutated versions from the original version. Although the idea was proposed more than a decade ago, it is in some ways still a `new' technique. Originally it was seen by many as costly and somewhat bizarre. However, several variants of the basic method have evolved and these, possibly in conjunction with more efficient techniques for applying the method, can help reduce the cost. Also, by guaranteeing the absence of particular errors, it may be one way to achieve the high reliability necessary in critical software. A further advantage of mutation testing is its universal applicability to all programming languages.},

@article{Adnane2014,
	Abstract = {One of the important challenges in model-driven engineering is how to improve the quality of the models' design in order to help designers understand them. Refactoring represents an efficient technique to improve the quality of a design while preserving its behavior. Most of existing work on model refactoring relies on declarative rules to detect refactoring opportunities and to apply the appropriate refactorings. However, a complete specification of refactoring opportunities requires a huge number of rules. In this paper, we consider the refactoring mechanism as a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find good refactoring suggestions starting from a small set of refactoring examples applied to similar contexts. Our approach, named model refactoring by example, takes as input an initial model to refactor, a set of structural metrics calculated on both initial model and models in the base of examples, and a base of refactoring examples extracted from different software systems and generates as output a sequence of refactorings. A solution is defined as a combination of refactoring operations that should maximize as much as possible the structural similarity based on metrics between the initial model and the models in the base of examples. A heuristic method is used to explore the space of possible refactoring solutions. To this end, we used and adapted a genetic algorithm as a global heuristic search. The validation results on different systems of real-world models taken from open-source projects confirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

The main concepts of finite state machines and mutation analysis are briefly introduced. An experiment is reported which manually applies mutation analysis to a finite state machine modeling a Class 0 ISO transport protocol specification, using two test-sequence generator criteria-the W method and the TT (transition tours) method. The results obtained are presented, and evidences are given that the use of mutation analysis is effective in this context. Finally, the lines of evolution of the work presented in this paper are briefly discussed},

	Abstract = {Mutation analysis is a program testing method which seeds a fault in a program and tries to identify it with test data, thus promoting the test efficiency. The paper investigates the application of mutation analysis in model-based testing for the modeling language of finite state machines (FSM). We describe a set of mutation operators for FSM based on the fault category; present an algorithm of selecting a test suite for the mutation testing of system models in FSM. In an experiment, other five methods of test suites generating and selecting for FSM are chosen to compare with the mutation testing method. The experiment shows that in respect of faults detecting in FSM, the mutation testing is more effective and efficient than the other FSM testing methods including D-method, W-method and T-method.},

@article{Arendt2012,
	Abstract = {The paradigm of model-based software development has become more and more popular since it promises an increase in the efficiency and quality of software development. Following this paradigm, models become primary artifacts in the software development process. Therefore, software quality and quality assurance frequently leads back to the quality and quality assurance of the involved models. In our approach, we propose a model quality assurance process that can be adapted to project-specific and domain-specific needs. This process is based on static model analysis using model metrics and model smells. Based on the outcome of the model analysis, appropriate model refactoring steps can be performed. In this paper, we present a tool environment conveniently supporting the proposed model quality assurance process. In particular, the presented tools support metrics reporting, smell detection, and refactoring for models being based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework, a widely used open source technology in model-based software development.},

	Abstract = {Assessment of the correctness of software models is a key issue to ensure the quality of the final application. To this end, this paper presents an automatic method for the verification of \{UML\} class diagrams extended with \{OCL\} constraints. Our method checks compliance of the diagram with respect to several correctness properties including weak and strong satisfiability or absence of constraint redundancies among others. The method works by translating the UML/OCL model into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) that is evaluated using state-of-the-art constraint solvers to determine the correctness of the initial model. Our approach is particularly relevant to current \{MDA\} and \{MDD\} methods where software models are the primary artifacts of the development process and the basis for the (semi-)automatic code-generation of the final application. },

	Abstract = {Statechart diagrams provide a graphical notation to model dynamic aspects of system behaviour within the unified modelling language (UML). In this paper, we present a formal operational semantics for a behavioural subset of \{UML\} statechart diagrams (UMLSDs) including a formal proof of their correctness with respect to major \{UML\} semantics requirements concerning behavioural issues. We show how the modularity of our semantics definition can be exploited to define extensions, in particular we show an extension to models composed of collections of communicating statechart diagrams, which we call multicharts. Finally we present all the conceptual issues related to building a tool for action based branching time model-checking, for the automatic verification of formal correctness of \{UML\} multicharts. The approach we propose preserves all the information necessary to report the results of model-checking in terms of the original \{UMLSD\} specification. The reference verification environment used for this model-checking approach is JACK, where automata are represented in a standard format which facilitates the use of a collection of tools for automatic verification. },

	Abstract = {Context-aware computing is a paradigm for governing the numerous mobile devices surrounding us. In this computing paradigm, software applications continuously and dynamically adapt to different ``contexts'' implying different software configurations of such devices. Unfortunately, modelling a context-aware application (CAA) for all possible contexts is only feasible in the simplest of cases. Hence, tool support verifying certain properties is required. In this article, we introduce the CAA model, in which context adaptations are specified explicitly as model transformations. By mapping this model to graphs and graph transformations, we can exploit graph transformation techniques such as critical pair analysis to find contexts for which the resulting application model is ambiguous. We validate our approach by means of an example of a mobile city guide, demonstrating that we can identify subtle context interactions that might go unnoticed otherwise.},

	Abstract = {Integrating new input devices and their associated interaction techniques into interactive applications has always been challenging and time-consuming, due to the learning curve and technical complexity involved. Modeling devices, interactions and applications helps reducing the accidental complexity. Visual modeling languages can hide an important part of the technical aspects involved in the development process, thus allowing a faster and less error-prone development process. However, even with the help of modeling, a gap remains to be bridged in order to go from models to the actual implementation of the interactive application. In this paper we use ICO, a visual formalism based on high-level Petri nets, to develop a generic layered framework for specifying executable models of interaction using gestural input devices. By way of the CASE tool Petshop we demonstrate the framework's feasibility to handle the Kinect and gesture-based interaction techniques. We validate the approach through two case studies that illustrate how to use executable, reusable and extensible ICO models to develop gesture-based applications.},

	Abstract = {With the popularity of model-driven methodologies and the abundance of modelling languages, a major question for a requirements engineer is: which language is suitable for modelling a system under study? We address this question from a semantic point-of-view for big-step modelling languages (BSMLs). BSMLs are a class of popular behavioural modelling languages in which a model can respond to an input by executing multiple transitions, possibly concurrently. We deconstruct the operational semantics of a large class of BSMLs into eight high-level, mostly orthogonal semantic aspects and their common semantic options. We analyse the characteristics of each semantic option. We use feature diagrams to present the design space of BSML semantics that arises from our deconstruction, as well as to taxonomize the syntactic features of BSMLs that exhibit semantic variations. We enumerate the dependencies between syntactic and semantic features. We also discuss the effects of certain combinations of semantic options when used together in a BSML semantics. Our goal is to empower a requirements engineer to compare and choose an appropriate BSML from the plethora of existing BSMLs, or to articulate the semantic features of a new desired BSML when such a BSML does not exist.},

In order to support maintenance tasks of these systems several techniques have been developed to analyze the source code of applications or to analyze the underlying databases for the purpose of reverse engineering, e.g. quality assurance or program comprehension. However, only a few techniques take into account the specialties of data-intensive systems (e.g. dependencies arising via database accesses). In this thesis we conducted research to analyze and to improve data-intensive applications via different methods based on static analysis: methods for recovering architecture of data-intensive systems and a quality assurance methodology for applications developed in Magic 4GL. We targeted SQL as the most widespread databases are relational databases using certain dialect of SQL for their queries. With the proposed techniques we were able to analyze large scale industrial projects, such as banking systems with more than 3 million lines of code, and we successfully recovered architecture maps and quality issues of these systems.},

@article{Cleve2015-scp,
	Abstract = {Abstract Database reverse engineering (DRE) has traditionally been carried out by considering three main information sources: (1) the database schema, (2) the stored data, and (3) the application programs. Not all of these information sources are always available, or of sufficient quality to inform the \{DRE\} process. For example, getting access to real-world data is often extremely problematic for information systems that maintain private data. In recent years, the analysis of the evolution history of software programs have gained an increasing role in reverse engineering in general, but comparatively little such research has been carried out in the context of database reverse engineering. The goal of this paper is to contribute to narrowing this gap and exploring the use of the database evolution history as an additional information source to aid database schema reverse engineering. We present a tool-supported method for analyzing the evolution history of legacy databases, and we report on a large-scale case study of reverse engineering a complex information system and curate it as a benchmark for future research efforts within the community. },

	Abstract = {Maintaining a productive and collaborative team of developers is essential to Open Source Software (OSS) success, and hinges upon the trust inherent among the team. Whether a project participant is initiated as a developer is a function of both his technical contributions and also his social interactions with other project participants. One's online social footprint is arguably easier to ascertain and gather than one's technical contributions e.g., gathering patch submission information re- quires mining multiple sources with different formats, and then merging the aliases from these sources. In contrast to prior work, where patch submission was found to be an essential ingredient to achieving developer status, here we investigate the extent to which the likelihood of achieving that status can be modeled solely as a social network phenomenon. For 6 different OSS projects we compile and integrate a set of social measures of the communications network among OSS project participants and a set of technical measures, i.e. OSS developers patch submission activities. We use these sets to predict whether a project participant will become a developer. We find that the social network metrics, in particular the amount of two-way communication a person participates in, are more significant predictors of one's likelihood to becoming a developer. Further, we find that this is true to the extent that other predictors, e.g. patch submission info, need not be included in the models. In addition, we show that future developers are easy to identify with great fidelity when using the first three months of data of their social activities. Moreover, only the first month of their social links are a very useful predictor, coming within 10% of the three month data's predictions. Finally, we find that it is easier to become a developer earlier in the projects lifecycle than it is later as the project matures. These results should provide insight on the social nature of gaining trust and advancing in status in distributed projects.},

	Abstract = {A frequent characterization of open source software is the somewhat outdated, mythical one of a collective of supremely talented software hackers freely volunteering their services to produce uniformly high-quality software. I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss the shift in the application of the bazaar metaphor from the development process to the product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground-rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

Little is known, however, about how professional developers navigate source code and the extent to which their hypotheses relate to their navigation. A lack of understanding of these issues is a barrier to tools aiming to reduce the large fraction of time developers spend navigating source code. In this paper, we report on a study that makes use of information foraging theory to investigate how professional developers navigate source code during maintenance. Our results showed that information foraging theory was a significant predictor of the developers' maintenance behavior, and suggest how tools used during maintenance can build upon this result, simply by adding word analysis to their reasoning systems.},

	Abstract = {Work practices vary among software developers. Some are highly focused on a few artifacts; others make wideranging contributions. Similarly, some artifacts are mostly authored, or ``owned'', by one or few developers; others have very wide ownership. Focus and ownership are related but different phenomena, both with strong effect on software quality. Prior studies have mostly targeted ownership; the measures of ownership used have generally been based on either simple counts, information-theoretic views of ownership, or social-network views of contribution patterns. We argue for a more general conceptual view that unifies developer focus and artifact ownership. We analogize the developer-artifact contribution network to a predator-prey food web, and draw upon ideas from ecology to produce a novel, and conceptually unified view of measuring focus and ownership. These measures relate to both cross-entropy and Kullback-Liebler divergence, and simultaneously provide two normalized measures of focus from both the developer and artifact perspectives. We argue that these measures are theoretically well-founded, and yield novel predictive, conceptual, and actionable value in software projects. We find that more focused developers introduce fewer defects than defocused developers. In contrast, files that receive narrowly focused activity are more likely to contain defects than other files.},

	Abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) development is often characterized as a fundamentally new way to develop software. Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

	Abstract = {Software vendors lack the perspective to develop software within a software ecosystem. The inability to function in a software ecosystem has already led to the demise of many software vendors, leading to loss of competition, intellectual property, and eventually jobs in the software industry. In this paper we present a research agenda on software ecosystems to study both the technical and the business aspects of software engineering in vibrant ecosystems. The results of such research enable software vendors to develop software that is adaptable to new business models and new markets, and to make strategic choices that help a software vendor to thrive in a software ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Past software engineering literature has firmly established that software architectures and the associated code decay over time. Architectural decay is, potentially, a major issue in free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) projects, since developers sporadically joining FLOSS projects do not always have a clear understanding of the underlying architecture, and may break the overall conceptual structure by several small changes to the code base. This paper investigates whether the structure of a FLOSS system and its decay can also be influenced by the repository in which it is retained: specifically, two FLOSS repositories are studied to understand whether the complexity of the software structure in the sampled projects is comparable, or one repository hosts more complex systems than the other. It is also studied whether the effort to counteract this complexity is dependent on the repository, and the governance it gives to the hosted projects.The results of the paper are two-fold: on one side, it is shown that the repository hosting larger and more active projects presents more complex structures. On the other side, these larger and more complex systems benefit from more anti-regressive work to reduce this complexity.},

	Abstract = {Reverse engineering is the process of recovering a projectpsilas components and the relationships between them with the goal of creating representations of the project at a higher level of abstraction. When dealing with the large amounts of information that are analyzed during reverse engineering visualization and exploratory navigation are important tools. However, a software system does not exist by itself. Instead, a project is part of a larger software ecosystem of projects that is developed in the context of an organization, a research group of an open-source community. In our work, we argue that reverse engineering an ecosystem is a natural and complementary extension to the traditional single system reverse engineering. We propose a methodology based on visualization, top-down exploration, architecture recovery and software evolution analysis for the reverse engineering software ecosystems. Our methodology starts with visualizing high-level structural and evolutionary aspects of the ecosystem from which the reverse engineer can navigate to views which present architectural aspects of the individual projects. To support our approach we implemented tool support for analyzing the ecosystem level as well as the intra-project level.},

	Abstract = { This paper explores the relationship between cumulative change and complexity in an evolving Open Source system. The study involves measurements at the function and file level. In order to measure cumulative change, the approach used a metric termed release-touches, which counts the number of releases for which a given file has been modified. Based on the value of this metric, we ranked the files and used the ranking in order to identify two groups, the more stable and the less stable parts of the source code. Complexity was measured using two derivatives of the McCabe index. Histograms and distributions were visually and statistically analyzed. The results empirically suggest that at the file level there are correlations between high cumulative change, large size and high complexity. This paper provides an approach for identifying with functions need to be refactored first if one wishes to reduce the complexity of the system.},

	Abstract = {Correcting software defects accounts for a significant amount of resources such as time, money and personnel. To be able to focus testing efforts where needed the most, researchers have studied statistical models to predict in which parts of a software future defects are likely to occur. By studying the mathematical relations between predictor variables used in these models, researchers can form an increased understanding of the important connections between development activities and software quality. Predictor variables used in past top-performing models are largely based on file-oriented measures, such as source code and churn metrics. However, source code is the end product of numerous interlaced and collaborative activities carried out by developers. Traces of such activities can be found in the repositories used to manage development efforts. In this paper, we investigate statistical models, to study the impact of social structures between developers and end-users on software quality. These models use predictor variables based on social information mined from the issue tracking and version control repositories of a large open-source software project. The results of our case study are promising and indicate that statistical models based on social information have a similar degree of explanatory power as traditional models. Furthermore, our findings suggest that social information does not substitute, but rather augments traditional product and process-based metrics used in defect prediction models.},

	Abstract = { In this paper, we conducted a comparative study of how social organization takes place in a wasp colony and OSS developer communities. Both these systems display similar global organization patterns, such as hierarchies and clear labor divisions. As our analysis shows, both systems also define interacting agent networks with similar common features that reflect limited information sharing among agents. As far as we know, this is the first research study analyzing the patterns and functional significance of these systems' weighted-interaction networks. By illuminating the extent to which self-organization is responsible for patterns such as hierarchical structure, we can gain insight into the origins of organization in OSS communities.},

@article{DBLP:journals/jss/Gonzalez95,
	Abstract = {There are different sources of software complexity. A large set of complexity metrics can measure distinct program attributes to show different program size indicators. Nevertheless, the size of a program must be obtained from the overall program complexity based on the values of all program factors. Based on the concept that software complexity is a measurement of the resources expended through the software life cycle, and the fact that a program may be approached from three distinct perspectives, the complexity factors are classified into three complexity domains: syntactical, functional, and computational. Each domain represents the magnitudes of the factors in one of the three dimensions: length, time, and level or depth. Using these ideas, in this article we define ordinal measures of the complexity factors based on discrete mathematical structures of programs and the information content or entropy, transform the different domains of software complexity in linear metric spaces in order to represent a program by a set of vectors whose magnitudes and distances represent metrics of the program components, and define a ``unified complexity metric'' of the program size and the effort needed to produce it over the multilinear complexity space conformed by the three complexity spaces. These metrics may be used to define a statistical method that estimates the size of a program and the effort needed to produce it from the external system design, the productivity in software projects, and the quality and value of software products.},

However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

@article{Cubranic2005,
	Abstract = {Sociological and technical difficulties, such as a lack of informal encounters, can make it difficult for new members of noncollocated software development teams to learn from their more experienced colleagues. To address this situation, we have developed a tool, named Hipikat that provides developers with efficient and effective access to the group memory for a software development project that is implicitly formed by all of the artifacts produced during the development. This project memory is built automatically with little or no change to existing work practices. After describing the Hipikat tool, we present two studies investigating Hipikat's usefulness in software modification tasks. One study evaluated the usefulness of Hipikat's recommendations on a sample of 20 modification tasks performed on the Eclipse Java IDE during the development of release 2.1 of the Eclipse software. We describe the study, present quantitative measures of Hipikat's performance, and describe in detail three cases that illustrate a range of issues that we have identified in the results. In the other study, we evaluated whether software developers who are new to a project can benefit from the artifacts that Hipikat recommends from the project memory. We describe the study, present qualitative observations, and suggest implications of using project memory as a learning aid for project newcomers.},

@article{Eshuis2009,
	Abstract = {Statecharts are a visual technique for modelling reactive behaviour. Over the years, a plethora of statechart semantics have been proposed. The three most widely used are the fixpoint, Statemate, and \{UML\} semantics. These three semantics differ considerably from each other. In general, they interpret the same statechart differently, which impedes the communication of statechart designs among both designers and tools. In this paper, we identify a set of constraints on statecharts that ensure that the fixpoint, Statemate and \{UML\} semantics coincide, if observations are restricted to linear, stuttering-closed, separable properties. Moreover, we show that for a subset of these constraints, a slight variation of the Statemate semantics coincides for linear stuttering-closed properties with the \{UML\} semantics. },

	Abstract = { There are many ideas in software design that are considered good
	practice. However, research is still needed to validate their contributions
	to software maintenance. This paper presents a method for examining
	software systems that have been actively maintained and used over
	the long term and are potential candidates for yielding lessons about
	design. The method relies on a criterion of stability and a definition
	of distance to flag design characteristics that have potentially
	contributed to long-term maintainability. It is demonstrated by application
	to an example of long-lived scientific software. The results from
	this demonstration show that the method can provide insight into
	the relative importance of individual elements of a set of design
	characteristics for the long-term evolution of software.},

	Abstract = {Feature diagrams (FD) are a family of popular modelling languages used for engineering requirements in software product lines. FD were first introduced by Kang as part of the FODA (feature oriented domain analysis) method back in 1990, Since then, various extensions of FODA FD were devised to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a proper formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity as well as a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation, In this paper, we first survey FD variants. Subsequently, we generalize the various syntaxes through a generic construction called free feature diagrams (FFD). Formal semantics is defined at the FFD level, which provides unambiguous definition for ail the surveyed FD variants in one shot. All formalisation choices found a clear answer in the original FODA FD definition, which proved that although informal and scattered throughout many pages, it suffered no ambiguity problem. Our definition has several additional advantages: it is formal, concise and generic. We thus argue that it contributes to improve the definition, understanding, comparison and reliable implementation of FD languages},

	Abstract = {Abstract Formal techniques for specifying and verifying Software Product Lines (SPL) are actively studied. While the foundations of this domain recently made significant progress with the introduction of Featured Transition Systems (FTSs) and associated algorithms, \{SPL\} model checking still faces the well-known state explosion problem. Moreover, there is a need for high-level specification languages usable in industry. We address the state explosion problem by applying the principles of symbolic model checking to FTS-based verification of SPLs. In order to specify properties on specific products only, we extend the temporal logic \{CTL\} with feature quantifiers. Next, we show how \{SPL\} behaviour can be specified with fSMV, a variant of SMV, the specification language of the industry-strength model checker NuSMV. fSMV is a feature-oriented extension of \{SMV\} originally introduced by Plath and Ryan. We prove that fSMV and \{FTSs\} are expressively equivalent. Finally, we connect these results to a NuSMV extension we developed for verifying \{SPLs\} against \{CTL\} properties. },

	Abstract = {We present a formal framework for notions related to testing and model based test generation for a behavioural subset of \{UML\} Statecharts (UMLSCs). This framework builds, on one hand, upon formal testing and conformance theory that has originally been developed in the context of process algebras and Labeled Transition Systems (LTSs), and, on the other hand, upon our previous work on formal semantics for UMLSCs. The paper covers the development of proper extensional testing preorders and equivalence for UMLSCs. We present an algorithm for testing equivalence verification which is based on an intensional characterization of the testing relations. Testing equivalence verification is reduced to bisimulation equivalence verification. We also address the issue of conformance testing and present a formal conformance relation together with a test case generation algorithm which is proved sound and exhaustive w.r.t. the conformance relation. We show results on the formal relationship of the testing relations with the conformance one. The comprehensive and uniform approach presented in this paper sets the theoretical basis for \{UMLSCs\} testing frameworks and makes them available for practitioners in industry where the \{UML\} has become a de facto standard, in particular there where it is used for the development of complex concurrent systems. },

	Abstract = {{Understanding complex systems often requires a bottom-up analysis towards a systems biology approach. The need to investigate a system, not only as individual components but as a whole, emerges. This can be done by examining the elementary constituents individually and then how these are connected. The myriad components of a system and their interactions are best characterized as networks and they are mainly represented as graphs where thousands of nodes are connected with thousands of vertices. In this article we demonstrate approaches, models and methods from the graph theory universe and we discuss ways in which they can be used to reveal hidden properties and features of a network. This network profiling combined with knowledge extraction will help us to better understand the biological significance of the system.}},

@techreport{barbacci95,
	Abstract = {Computer systems are used in many critical applications where a failure can have serious consequences (loss of lives or property). Developing systematic ways to relate the software quality attributes of a system to the system's architecture provides a sound basis for making objective decisions about design trade-offs and enables engineers to make reasonably accurate predictions about a system's attributes that are free from bias and hidden assumptions. The ultimate goal is the ability to quantitatively evaluate and trade off multiple software quality attributes to arrive at a better overall system. The purpose of this report is to take a small step in the direction of developing a unifying approach for reasoning about multiple software quality attributes. In this report, we define software quality, introduce a generic taxonomy of attributes, discuss the connections between the attributes, and discuss future work leading to an attribute-based methodology for evaluating software architectures.

Although a number of context models have been presented in the literature, none of them supports all of these requirements to a sufficient extent at the same time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and integrated approach for context modeling in pervasive computing environments. It combines the advantages of existing approaches and addresses the need for supporting effective software development. The proposed context model follows an ontology-based approach and has three layers of abstraction, i.e. conceptual layer, exchange layer, and functional layer. This layered approach facilitates a model-driven development of context-aware applications. Throughout the paper we compare our solution with the related work in order to clearly demonstrate why we needed to develop a new context management framework and where we have adopted existing ideas.},

The space of monitorable entities is huge and each context-aware application has specific monitoring requirements which can change at runtime as a result of new opportunities or constraints due to context variations. The issues dealt with in this paper are 1) to guide context-aware application designers in the specification of the monitoring of distributed context sources, and 2) to allow the adaptation of context management capabilities by dynamically taking into account new context data collectors not foreseen during the development process. The solution we present, CA3M, follows the model-driven engineering approach for answering the previous questions: 1) designers specialised into context management specify context-awareness concerns into models that conform to a context-awareness meta-model, and 2) these context-awareness models are present at runtime and may be updated to cater with new application requirements. This paper presents the whole chain from the context-awareness model definition to the dynamic instantiation of context data collectors following modifications of context-awareness models at runtime.},

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and experiences of developing a context management system that incorporates these ideas. It is based on a consumer-provider broker model, where providers employ a common context representation format, decoupling various entities involved in the production and consumption of context information. We demonstrate how the idea of independent context providers can aid in end-to-end working of a context management framework. One of the major advantages compared to other approaches is the extendibility of the system. By progressively adding Context Providers to legacy mobile communication systems, new context domains can be added.

This change inevitably affects the software running on such devices by necessitating additional functionality such as context awareness and adaptive behavior. While some developers design their systems to be fully self-reliant with regard to context awareness, others aim for more synergistic approaches by allowing context sharing across devices. This paper describes our experience with first designing and implementing a basic context management system, and then with extending it to allow context distribution. In the proposed architecture, the developers define the context dependencies for their software independently of the availability of context information in their corresponding devices. An automated mechanism is then used to match these needs to the corresponding providers, even when those reside across distributed devices. This approach enables them to utilize shared context information at runtime thus reducing both development efforts and hardware costs.},

In this perspective, we introduce the Context Matching Engine that trades off the cost, the user preferences and the quality of the available context information in order to discover the best context sources for each customized context-aware service. According to the proposed approach, there is no need for the services to know beforehand the context providers to retrieve information, but the evaluation and the quality-aware selection of the context information on context request are envisioned. Finally, it allows services to be ported easily to environments with different set of context sources.},

@article{Dey:Mediation:2005,
	Abstract = {Many context-aware services make the assumption that the context they use is completely accurate. However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. Although some of this ambiguity may be resolved using automatic techniques, we argue that correct handling of ambiguous context will often need to involve the user. We use the term mediation to refer to the dialogue that ensues between the user and the system. In this article, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments. We present design guidelines that arise from supporting mediation over space and time, issues not present in the graphical user interface domain where mediation has typically been used in the past. We illustrate the use of our architecture and evaluate it through an example context-aware application, a word predictor system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Mobile context-aware applications are required to sense and react to changing environment conditions. Such applications, usually, need to recognize, classify and predict context in order to act efficiently, beforehand, for the benefit of the user. In this paper, we propose a mobility prediction model, which deals with context representation and location prediction of moving users. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used for trajectory classification. Spatial and temporal on-line clustering is adopted. We rely on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) for location prediction. Location prediction is treated as a context classification problem. We introduce a novel classifier that applies a Hausdorff-like distance over the extracted trajectories handling location prediction. Since our approach is time-sensitive, the Hausdorff distance is considered more advantageous than a simple Euclidean norm. A learning method is presented and evaluated. We compare ART with Offline kMeans and Online kMeans algorithms. Our findings are very promising for the use of the proposed model in mobile context aware applications.},

However, CML currently lacks a suitable representation for exchanging context models and instances in distributed systems. A runtime representation can be used by context-aware applications and supporting infrastructure to exchange context information and models between distributed components, and it can be used as the storage representation when relational database facilities are not present.

In this paper we examine how OMGs Model Driven Architecture (MDA) can be applied to tackle the issues of context modelling and Context-Aware Application (CAA) modelling and development. A Context Ontology Model (COM) is presented to model context information at two levels: upper-level and extended specific level. A Model Driven Integration Architecture (MDIA) is then proposed to integrate rigorous model specifications and generate CAA implementations either semi-automatically or automatically.},

High-level context information, however, poses several challenges to context management systems, which can be traced back to the asynchronicity of context acquisition and use and the inherent dynamics and imperfection in that process. This paper presents a three layer model allowing for dealing with the problems of imperfection and aging in a controlled way. It conceives the problem of high-level user context management as an information management problem with specific requirements. The approach has been applied to a context-aware learning environment for corporate learning support.},

They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.},

Existing context management system implicitly assumes that a context representing user's situation can be fallen into just one of the two states such as valid or invalid. We observed that, however, a context can have additional state and transfer from one state to another seamlessly according to the change of a user-related context Such as user's location. The behavior of corresponding applications can also be finely tuned so that we can provide more adaptive services. For demonstration, we use the ontology for modeling and enriching the life cycle of a context. It enables LIS to utilize high-level inference capability which derives the current situation of a user. We also enhance the functionality of existing context management middleware using the context life cycle management scheme in this paper.},

@article{Zimmermanetal:Personaliz:2005,
	Abstract = {Supporting the individual user in his working, learning, or information access is one of the main goals of user modeling. Personal or group user models make it possible to represent and use information about preferences, knowledge, abilities, emotional states, and many other characteristics of a user to adapt the user experience and support. Nowadays, the disappearing computer enables the user to access her information from a variety of personal and public displays and devices. To support a new generation of contextualized and personalized information and services, this paper addresses the problem of context management. Context management is a new approach to the design of context-aware systems in ubiquitous computing that combines personalization and contextualization. The presented framework for context management integrates user modeling and context modeling, which can benefit from each other and give rise to more valid models for personalized and contextualized information delivery. The paper will introduce a base framework and tools for designing context-aware applications and decompose the underlying framework into its foundational components. As two illustrative application cases, the paper discusses implementations of an intelligent advertisement board and an audio-augmented museum environment.},

The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up systems perspective and a top-down users perspective.

	Abstract = {{The term ``Linked Data{''} refers to a set of best practices for
   publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. These best
   practices have been adopted by an increasing number of data providers
   over the last three years, leading to the creation of a global data
   space containing billions of assertions-the Web of Data. In this
   article, the authors present the concept and technical principles of
   Linked Data, and situate these within the broader context of related
   technological developments. They describe progress to date in publishing
   Linked Data on the Web, review applications that have been developed to
   exploit the Web of Data, and map out a research agenda for the Linked
   Data community as it moves forward.}},

	Abstract = {In this paper a method for Partial {RDF} Encryption {(PRE)} is
proposed in which sensitive data in an {RDF-graph} is encrypted for a set
of recipients while all non-sensitive data remain publicly readable. The
result is an {RDF-compliant} self-describing graph containing encrypted
data, encryption metadata, and plaintext data. For the representation
of encrypted data and encryption metadata, the {XML-Encryption} and
{XML-Signature} recommendations are used. The proposed method allows
for fine-grained encryption of arbitrary subjects, predicates, objects and
subgraphs of an {RDF-graph.} An {XML} vocabulary for specifying encryption
policies is introduced.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive systems respond to changes in their internal state or external environment with guidance from an underlying control system. ULS systems are particularly likely to require dynamic adaptation because of their decentralized control and the large number of independent stakeholders whose actions are integral to the system's behavior. Adaptation may take various forms, but the system structure will almost inevitably include one or more closed feedback loops. We argue that adaptability is a characteristic of a solution, not of a problem, and that the feedback loop governing control of adaptability should be explicit in design and analysis and either explicit or clearly traceable in implementation.},

	the high cost and high risks of redevelopment as well as the substantial

	Abstract = {We describe a method to migrate multiple instances of a successful
	single information system to a product line. The deployed product
	line is able to deal with the variants evolved over time in a cost-effective
	manner. We proposed and used federated architectures that partition
	the software into so-called genericity layers. We argue that federated
	architectures are at the heart of product lines, and we provide compelling
	arguments as to why federated architectures are a sound weapon in
	today's corporate strategy: they enable smooth enterprise integration
	and rapid change. We support our arguments with a real-world case:
	we successfully migrated a large global transaction and settlement
	system with many site-specific variations to a product line with
	a federated architecture. Moreover, we measured the success rate
	of this architectural modification effort by showing that the annual
	direct cost savings are of the order of millions of dollars during
	the deployment of the product line. Copyright {\copyright} 2003 John Wiley

	an important contributor to the core assets for software product
	lines, systematic methods for making decisions on when to incorporate
	legacy assets (versus building new assets) have not been available.
	Two methods developed by the Software Engineering Institute fill
	this gap: the Mining Architectures for Product Lines (MAP) method
	and the Options Analysis for Reengineering (OAR) method. Both of
	these methods, which are described in this report, support different
	aspects of the Product Parts Pattern, which is applied to develop
	the core assets for a product line. The MAP method provides a suitability
	analysis of existing systems' software architectures as candidates
	for a product line architecture. After an architecture has been developed
	or chosen, the OAR method provides a disciplined approach for making
	decisions on rehabilitating legacy assets that may be incorporated
	into the product line asset base. This technical note describes both
	the MAP and OAR methods, the activities that each involves, and examples
	of applying them.},

	Abstract = {Software product lines have proved to be a successful and efficient
	means for managing the development of software in industry. The significant
	benefits over traditional software architectures have the potential
	to convince software companies to adopt the product line approach
	for their existing products. In that case, the question arises how
	to best convert the existing products into a software product line.
	For several reasons, an evolutionary approach is desirable. But so
	far, there is little guidance on the evolutionary introduction of
	software product lines. In this paper, we propose a lightweight iterative
	process supporting the incremental introduction of product line concepts
	for existing software products. Starting with the analysis of the
	legacy code, we assess what parts of the software can be restructured
	for product line needs at reasonable costs. For the analysis of the
	products, we use feature analysis, a reengineering technique tailored
	to the specific needs of the initiation of software product lines.},

	Abstract = {Library migration is the process of replacing a third-party library in favor of a competing one during software maintenance. The process of transforming a software source code to become compliant with a new library is cumbersome and error-prone. Indeed, developers have to understand a new Application Programming Interface (API) and search for the right replacements for the functions they use from the old library. As the two libraries are independent, the functions may have totally different structures and names, making the search of mappings very difficult. To assist the developers in this difficult task, we introduce an approach that analyzes source code changes from software projects that already underwent a given library migration to extract mappings between functions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on several library migrations performed on the Java open source software projects.},

	Abstract = {Software intensively depends on external libraries whose relevance may change during its life cycle. As a consequence, software developers must periodically reconsider the libraries they depend on, and must think about replacing them for more relevant ones. We refer to this practice as library migration. To find the best replacement for their library, they can rely on information over the Web, but they get quickly overwhelmed by the amount of data they gather. Making the right choice in this context constitutes the topic of our work. The solution we propose is to exhibit and mine the library migrations trends computed by performing a study of a large set of software projects. To perform this analysis, we have defined an automatic approach to compute library dependencies and a semi-automatic approach that identifies library migrations. Then, we propose a deep analysis of the library migration phenomena by performing a descriptive study of a large set of software projects stored on the Github platform. Second, based on our descriptive study, we propose a support to developers who want to migrate their libraries. The main result of our study is that recommendations of libraries can be inferred from the analysis of the migration trends.},

	Abstract = {Software systems emerge from mere keystrokes to form intricate functional networks connecting many collaborating modules, objects, classes, methods, and subroutines. Building on recent advances in the study of complex networks, I have examined software collaboration graphs contained within several open-source software systems, and have found them to reveal scale-free, small-world networks similar to those identified in other technological, sociological, and biological systems. I present several measures of these network topologies, and discuss their relationship to software engineering practices. I also present a simple model of software system evolution based on refactoring processes which captures some of the salient features of the observed systems. Some implications of object-oriented design for questions about network robustness, evolvability, degeneracy, and organization are discussed in the wake of these findings.},

@article{Jansen2014,
	Abstract = {Background
The livelihood of an open source ecosystem is important to different ecosystem participants: software developers, end-users, investors, and participants want to know whether their ecosystem is healthy and performing well. Currently, there exists no working operationalization available that can be used to determine the health of open source ecosystems. Health is typically looked at from a project scope, not from an ecosystem scope.

Objectives
With such an operationalization, stakeholders can make better decisions on whether to invest in an ecosystem: developers can select the healthiest ecosystem to join, keystone organizers can establish which governance techniques are effective, and end-users can select ecosystems that are robust, will live long, and prosper.

Method
Design research is used to create the health operationalization. The evaluation step is done using four ecosystem health projects from literature.

Results
The Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization is provided, which establishes the health of a complete software ecosystem, using the data from collections of open source projects that belong to the ecosystem.

Conclusion
The groundwork is done, by providing a summary of research challenges, for more research in ecosystem health. With the operationalization in hand, researchers no longer need to start from scratch when researching open source ecosystems' health.},

	Abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤ t<sub>1</sub>' ≤ t<sub>2</sub>' ≤ ⋯ ≤ t<sub>N</sub>'. Then <tex-math>$\hat{P}(t) = \prod_r \lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1)\rbrack$</tex-math>, where r assumes those values for which t<sub>r</sub>' ≤ t and for which t<sub>r</sub>' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new fault-localization technique designed for applications that interact with a relational database. The technique uses dynamic information specific to the application's database, such as Structured Query Language (SQL) commands, to provide a fault-location diagnosis. By creating statement-SQL tuples and calculating their suspiciousness, the presented method lets the developer identify the database commands and the program statements likely to cause the failures. The technique also calculates suspiciousness for statement-attribute tuples and uses this information to identify SQL fragments that are statistically likely to be responsible for the suspiciousness of that SQL command. The paper reports the results of two empirical studies. The first study compares existing and database-aware fault-localization methods, and reveals the strengths and limitations of prior techniques, while also highlighting the effectiveness of the new approach. The second study demonstrates the benefits of using database information to improve understanding and reduce manual debugging effort.},

To detect the SQL injection attack, the parsing and the black list based on the existed attack have been widely used.

In this paper, we proposed the detecting method based on single character, and show the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally using both attack and normal samples.},
