\section{CONCLUSION}

Given my PhD research project just started, I only have preliminary results about the socio-technical congruence of the Cargo packaging ecosystem and how it evolves over time.
During my 4-year PhD studies, I intend to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of this phenomenon, and complement this by studying the expected positive effects of such congruence on the health of the ecosystem community, such as increased popularity, productivity, responsiveness, contributor intake and retention.
I intend to conduct similar studies on other packaging ecosystems  (e.g. npm, RubyGems, Maven, CRAN, Packagist), in order to compare their socio-technical congruence and the effect of ecosystem-specific policies and values.
