\section{CONCLUSION}

Given my PhD research project just started, I only have preliminary results about the evolution of the socio-technical congruence of the Cargo packaging ecosystem.
During my PhD studies I intend to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of this phenomenon, and complement this by studying the expected benefits on the ecosystem's health, such as increased popularity, productivity, responsiveness, contributor intake and retention.
I intend to conduct similar studies on other packaging ecosystems, in order to compare their socio-technical congruence and the effect of ecosystem-specific policies and values.
